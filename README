Code is written in C++ and project can be built and run in the IDE of your choice. 
These are steps to run in command line.

TO RUN
--------
To compile in command line, enter the src directory and run commands:

> make
> ./a.out


UPDATED
-------------------------------
make: 			builds main.cpp
./a.out:		runs built project


OLD
-------------------------------
make run: 		runs main.exe (observe console output)
make clean: 	removes main.exe, must run make again to run project
